A simple Tri Peaks patience (solitaire) game.

This is a remake of tripeaks-gdx project, my previous implementation of the same game.

Main Features:
- Four board layouts
- An option to show the values of face-down cards
- An option to start with an empty discard pile, allowing the player to choose any starting card
- An option to ensure the created games are solvable
- Aggregated and per-layout statistics
- Portrait and landscape orientation support
