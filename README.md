# TriPeaks NEUE

A simple [Tri Peaks game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tri_Peaks_(game)), using Flutter. This is a remake of [my previous implementation](https://github.com/mimoguz/tripeaks-gdx) of the same game.<br>

## Credit where credit is due

While it's not a copy, I hope, the game draws a lot of design inspiration from Dustland Design's Solitaire - The Clean One. Credit where credit is due.

## DYNAMIC_RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED_PERMISSION issue

If you check the required permissions for this game on F-Droid, you will see that it requires ```DYNAMIC_RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED_PERMISSION```.

The best explanation I could find about this was again in the F-Droid repository:

* A closed merge request: [Don't catalog androidx DYNAMIC_RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED_PERMISSION hack](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver/-/merge_requests/1336) 
* An open issue: [handle androidx DYNAMIC_RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED_PERMISSION hack](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/issues/2608)

**Tl;dr**: As far as I could understand, it's a compatibility hack rather than a true permission. Its existence means that the application uses broadcasts, but only internally and rejects intents coming from outside.
